This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for the frontend and uses Django for the backend.

### Frontend Setup (React)

1. **Start the React Application**

   In the project directory for your React app, run the following command to start the frontend:

   ```bash
   npm start

This command runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to view it.
The page will reload automatically if you make any edits.
You will see any lint errors in the console.
Available Scripts

2. In the React project directory, you can run:

npm test: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
npm run build: Builds the app for production to the build folder. Optimizes the build for the best performance.
npm run eject: Note that this is a one-way operation! It allows you to customize the build tool and configuration choices.
