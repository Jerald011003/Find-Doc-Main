# Getting Started with Create React App and Django Backend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for the frontend and uses Django for the backend.

## Frontend Setup (React)

### 1. Start the React Application

In the project directory for your React app, you can run the following command to start the frontend:

    ```bash
    npm start

This command runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to view it.
The page will reload automatically if you make any edits.
You will see any lint errors in the console.
